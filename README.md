# img2tex
A small tool that converts images of math formulas to LaTeX code. It uses GitHub Pages, AWS Lambda, and OpenRouter for simplicity.

The AWS API key is stored locally in your browser and only needs to be entered once. A filled API-Key field (black dots) shows that your key is saved.

The offered demo mode exposes one of the AWS API keys but is restricted to 200 requests per week using AWS Usage Plans
